### Features

- Introduces the user to the theme of our project. 3D models are rendered using Threejs.
- In Korean sign language, "수화" combines "수" meaning "hand" in Hanja (Chinese characters) with "화," which typically means "conversation," but can also signify "flower." This unique interpretation inspired our theme, "손으로 피우는 꽃," meaning "flowers blooming from hands."
